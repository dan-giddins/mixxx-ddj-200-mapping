# mixxx-ddj-200-mapping

A mapping for the Pioneer DDJ-200 for the open source DJ software MIXXX (https://www.mixxx.org/)

A pull request for support for the DDJ-200 has been raised to bring the functionality into the program by default, but for now you can get the controller working by downloading DDJ-200.midi.xml and Pioneer-DDJ-200-scripts.js into C:\Users\\\<user>\AppData\Local\Mixxx\controllers\ (also known as the "User Preset Folder" in Preferences -> Controllers)
